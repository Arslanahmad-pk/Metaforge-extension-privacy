## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the MetaForge Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our service to generate metadata for Adobe Stock images.

## Information We Collect

### Gemini API Key
- We collect and store the Google Gemini API key that you provide to enable image analysis and metadata generation.
- This API key is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API and is not transmitted to any servers other than Google's Gemini API service.

### Image Data
- The extension processes images from Adobe Stock pages to generate metadata.
- Images are temporarily processed and sent to the Gemini API for analysis.
- We do not permanently store any images on our servers.

### User Preferences and Settings
- Language preferences for metadata generation
- Metadata settings (e.g., number of keywords, title length limits)
- Processing ranges and status information

### Usage Statistics

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information solely for the purpose of:
- Generating optimized titles and keywords for your Adobe Stock images
- Saving your preferences to enhance your experience with the extension
- Providing processing status and statistics

## Data Storage and Security

- All user data (including API keys) is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API.
- No user data is transmitted to our servers.
- The only external service we connect to is the Google Gemini API to process images and generate metadata.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties except as described below:
